## Lab feedback

 * How long did you spend on this lab? 
   * It took me a few hours to complete the lab.

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
   * I thought it was a useful lab. I revised some of my HTML and CSS skills and got to exercise some of my creativity. One potential improvement could be to have one small project to work on.
